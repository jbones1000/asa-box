Thomas Friedman can say some pretty insightful things as he's been covering this conflict and region for decades. But then he says something blatantly racist that throws away all his credibility like: 

"This is ugly stuff, but the Middle East is a Hobbesian jungle. It is not Scandinavia."

First off this is a classic clich√© misunderstanding of Hobbes' theory, all states even Scandinavian ones are Leviathans. which brings me to my second point, implying that the violence and lack of democracy in the middle east is unique to the region is Orientalist and based in not a lot of fact. 

Thirdly this racism is what keeps Friedman obsessed with a two-state, separate but equal, solution. He simply cannot fathom Arabs and Israelis sharing one democratic and inclusive state.
